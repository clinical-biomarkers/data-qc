It is known that TMPRSS2 expression is upregulated by androgens in prostate cancer cell lines and in vivo. The authors analyzed data from 4,532 men who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these patients, 430 (9.5%) had cancer and 118 (2.6%) had prostate cancer (28% of all cancers). Consistent with other publications, men with cancer have worse disease presentations than men without cancer, even when stratified for age. In the 5,273 prostate cancer patients on androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); only four of these patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The authors stated that men positive for SARS-CoV-2 and on ADT not only had improved outcomes over other men with prostate cancer positive for SARS-CoV-2, but that ADT may have reduced the chance of infection. They concluded that ADT had a protective effect in men positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. ADT therapy provides the first evidence that reducing androgens or their effect on tissues may have a beneficial impact on outcomes in men infected with SARS-CoV-2.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

The sample consisted of volunteer patients and was divided in a control group (n = 26), type 2 diabetic group (n = 16), hypertensive group (n = 12) and type 2 diabetic/hypertensive group (n = 26). In addition, blood glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were determined. Serum cholinesterase activity in the control group was significantly lower in relation to the other groups (p < 0.001). Blood glucose levels were elevated in type 2 diabetic and type 2 diabetic/hypertensive groups. In vitro studies showed increased cholinesterase activity in the presence of glucose 5100 mM or insulin 0.525 UI (p < 0.001). Cholesterol and triglycerides were at normal levels only in the control group. Possibly, a relationship exists between the increase in serum cholinesterase and the vascular complications in the diabetic patients, potentially stimulated by the levels of glycemia and dyslipidemia. Although patients were receiving different medicines, the increase in enzyme activity was similar in all groups. This enzymatic profile suggests a possible interference of the diseases in the catalytic mechanism of the serum cholinesterase enzyme.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

Prognostic analysis of YAP1 demonstrated a significant correlation between mRNA expression level data and reduced overall survival (p = 0.001). In addition, TMA and immunohistochemistry analysis suggested that YAP1 protein expression is an independent predictor of poor overall survival [hazard ratio (HR) 1.870, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.224‚Äì2.855, p = 0.004], as well as reduced disease-free survival (HR 1.950, 95% CI 1.299‚Äì2.927, p = 0.001). Bioinformatic analyses coupled with in vitro assays indicated that YAP1 is involved in the transcriptional control of target genes, associated with extracellular matrix remodeling, which could be modified by selected substances disrupting the YAP1-TEAD interaction. We demonstrate that YAP1 is an independent prognostic marker associated with recurrence and unfavorable survival in pancreatic cancer. We also show that inhibition of YAP1/TEAD interaction interferes with the expression of AREG, CTGF, CYR61, and MSLN suggesting that YAP1 transcriptional activity may affect the development and persistence of a fibrotic tumor microenvironment. YAP1 is thus considered as a clinically and biologically relevant biomarker derived from pancreatic cancer tissue.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

DKK-1 expression was also found to be higher in all PCa metastatic lesions (56¬±21 EI) compared to non-neoplastic tissues but was significantly decreased vs. primary PCa lesions (p<0.008). The decline in DKK-1 correlated with a shift of beta-catenin staining from the nucleus to the cytoplasm suggesting possible mechanism for the observed decrease in DKK-1 levels during PCa progression. Within metastatic lesions, DKK-1 expression was least abundant in PCa bone metastases relative to all soft tissue PCa metastatic lesions except lymph node metastases. High DKK-1 expression within PCa metastases was further associated with shorter over-all patient survival.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

We conclude that expression of IMP3, a newly identified cytoplasmic marker, is closely associated with type II endometrial cancer. It seems that IMP3 expression is associated with an aggressive histologic phenotype among endometrial neoplastic lesions. Strong and diffuse IMP3 expression is highly sensitive for endometrial serous and clear cell carcinomas including their putative precursor lesions. Therefore, IMP3 may be a useful diagnostic marker in the assessment of endometrial cancers and their precursor lesions, particularly when the amount of available tissue material is limited and a concern of type II cancer arises.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

CSV+ PD-L1+ CTCs were observed in 50 of 70 (71%) GC patient samples, ranging from 0 to 261 mL-1. A higher number of CSV+ PD-L1+ CTCs were significantly associated with a short survival duration and poor therapeutic response. This study demonstrated that detection of PD-L1+ CTCs using a CSV-enrichment method has promising value as a clinically relevant prognostic marker for GC.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

Mechanistically, autophagy inhibition led to the accumulation of p62/SQSTM1 and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kB, in which NF-kB inhibition or p62/SQSTM1 knockdown attenuated PD-L1 induction by autophagy inhibition. Immunohistochemical staining of primary tumor tissues of 137 patients with gastric cancer showed that LC3 and p62/SQSTM1 protein levels were positively correlated with PD-L1 (LC3, p < 0.001; p62/SQSTM1, p < 0.05). The expression of PD-L1 was also positively correlated with tumor lymphocyte infiltration (p < 0.001). We discovered that autophagy regulates PD-L1 expression in gastric cancer through the p62/SQSTM1-NF-kB pathway. Pharmacological modulation of autophagy may thus influence the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 blockade in gastric cancer.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

The forced expression of ARPP-19 promoted, whereas the silencing of ARPP-19 impaired Herceptin resistance of HER2-positive gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, ARPP-19 significantly enhanced the sphere formation capacity and CD44 expression, CD44 was also a positive factor of Herceptin resistance in HER2-positive gastric cancer cells. In addition, high level of ARPP-19 was positively associated with Herceptin resistance and poor survival rate of gastric cancer patients. We have demonstrated that ARPP-19 promoted Herceptin resistance of gastric cancer via up-regulation of CD44, our study suggested that ARPP-19 could be a potential diagnostic and therapeutic candidate for HER2-positive gastric cancer.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

Genes expressed only in cancer tissue, and especially on the cell membrane, will be useful molecular markers for diagnosis and may also be good therapeutic targets. To identify genes that encode transmembrane proteins present in GC, we generated Escherichia coli ampicillin secretion trap (CAST) libraries from two GC cell lines and normal stomach. By sequencing 4320 colonies from CAST libraries, we identified 30 candidate genes that encode transmembrane proteins present in GC. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis of these candidates revealed that ZDHHC14, BST2, DRAM2, and DSC2 were expressed much more highly in GC than in 14 kinds of normal tissues. Among these, DSC2 encodes desmocollin 2, which is one of three known desmocollins. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that 22 (28%) of 80 GC cases were positive for desmocollin 2, and desmocollin 2 expression was observed frequently in GC with the intestinal mucin phenotype. Furthermore, desmocollin 2 expression was correlated with CDX2 expression. These results suggest that expression of desmocollin 2, induced by CDX2, may be a key regulator for GC with the intestinal mucin phenotype. Our results provide a list of genes that have high potential as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for GC.	biomarker;assessed_biomarker_entity;specimen;best_biomarker_role;condition

Blocking OLFM4 expression can sensitize gastric cancer cells to H2O2 or TNF alpha treatment by increasing caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. The elimination of OLFM4 protein by RNA interference in SGC-7901 and MKN45 cells significantly inhibits tumorigenicity both in vitro and in vivo by induction of cell G1 arrest (all P < 0.01).
